        This document defines a signal, transmitted over HTTP and through the DOM, that conveys a
        user's request to websites and services to not sell or share their personal information with
        third parties. This standard is intended to work with existing and upcoming legal frameworks
        that render such requests enforceable.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Building websites today often requires relying on services provided by businesses other than
        the one which the user choses to interact with. This result is a natural consequence of the
        increasing complexity of Web technology and of the division of labor between different
        services. While this architecture can be used in the service of better Web experiences,
        it can also be abused to violate user privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several legal frameworks exist â€” and more are on the way â€” within which users have the right
        to request that their privacy be protected, including requests that their data not be sold
        or shared beyond the business with which they intend to interact. Requiring that users
        express their rights for each and every site they visit is, however, impractical.
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/privacy/ccpa-fsor.pdf">
        <p>
          Given the ease and frequency by which personal information is collected and sold when a
          consumer visits a website, consumers should have a similarly easy ability to request to
          opt-out globally. This regulation offers consumers a global choice to opt-out of the sale
          of personal information, as opposed to going website by website to make individual
          requests with each business each time they use a new browser or a new device.
          [[CCPA-AG-FINAL-STATEMENT]]

      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This specification addresses the issue by providing a way to signal, through an HTTP header
        or the DOM, a user's assertion of their applicable rights to prevent selling their data to
        third parties or sharing data with them. This signal is equivalent, for example, to the
        "global privacy control" in the CCPA [[CCPA-REGULATIONS]].

      <h2>Expressing a Do Not Sell Or Share Preference</h2>
      <section>
        <h3>Expression Format</h3>
        <p>
          If a user has requested that their data "not be sold or shared" via setting a Global Privacy Control
          preference, that preference needs to be expressed to all mechanisms that might collect data
          from or share data with third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          If set, this preference is expressed as a single value of <code>1</code> or equivalently
          <code>true</code> according to context, which conveys the fact that a user is requesting a
          <a>do-not-sell-or-share interaction</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the absence of regulatory, legal, or other requirements, servers MAY interpret an
          expressed Global Privacy Control preference as they find most appropriate for the given
          user, particularly as considered in light of the user's privacy expectations, context, and
          cultural circumstances. Likewise, servers might make use of other preference information
          outside the scope of this protocol, such as site-specific user preferences or third-party
          registration services, to inform or adjust their behavior when no explicit preference is
          expressed via this protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents are expected to convey user preferences as accurately
          as they can. User agents SHOULD strive to represent what the user
          agent best believes to be the user's preference for the Global
          Privacy Control value.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The <code>Sec-GPC</code> Header Field for HTTP Requests</h3>
        <p>
          The <dfn><code>Sec-GPC</code></dfn> header field is a mechanism for expressing the user's
          preference for a <a>do-not-sell-or-share interaction</a> in an HTTP request. At most one
          <code>Sec-GPC</code> header field can be present in a valid request.
        </p>
        <pre class="hljs">
          Sec-GPC-field-name  = "Sec-GPC"
          Sec-GPC-field-value = "1"
        </pre>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST NOT generate a <code>Sec-GPC</code> header field if the user's Global
          Privacy Control preference is not enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          A user agent MUST generate a <code>Sec-GPC</code> header field with a field-value that
          is exactly the numeric character "1" if the user's Global Privacy Control preference is
          set.
        </p>
        <aside class="example" title="Example GPC Request">
          <pre class="hljs http">
            GET /something/here HTTP/1.1
            Host: example.com
            Sec-GPC: 1
          </pre>

          <h4>
            Extensibility of the Sec-GPC Field Value
          </h4>
          <p>
            The <a><code>Sec-GPC</code></a> is deliberately defined without an extension mechanism.
            Experience with previous similar headers shows that people tend to rely on string
            equality instead of parsing the value when testing for their presence, especially when
            extensions do not yet exist. Such checks would of course fail in the presence of
            extension content, which would in turn render the mechanism moot. Should extensions
            prove necessary to this standard, they will need to be implemented through other
            headers, which may in time supersede this one.
          </p>

        <h2>JavaScript Property to Detect Preference</h2>
        <p>
          The <code><dfn>Navigator.globalPrivacyControl</dfn></code> property enables a client-side
          script to determine what <a><code>Sec-GPC</code></a> header field value would be sent to
          the <a>effective script origin</a> when referenced by the active document's <a>top-level
          browsing context</a>.
        </p>
        <pre class="idl">
          partial interface Navigator {
            readonly attribute boolean globalPrivacyControl;
          };
        </pre>
        <p>
          The value is <code>false</code> if no <code>Sec-GPC</code> header field would be sent;
          otherwise, the value is <code>true</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, the value of <a>Navigator.globalPrivacyControl</a> for a given script is
          <code>true</code> if a user has requested that their data "not be sold or shared" via
          setting a Global Privacy Control preference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, the value of <a>Navigator.globalPrivacyControl</a> ought to reflect the preference
          of the user when the attribute is read. In practice, however, the value might only reflect
          the value that was in effect when the script was initiated.
        </p>

      <h2>GPC Support Resource</h2>
      <p>
        A site MAY produce a resource at a .well-known URL in order for a site to represent the fact
        that it abides by GPC. The purpose of a GPC Support Resource is for a site to convey its
        support for the Global Privacy Control. By default, an origin's support is <em>unknown</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A GPC Support Resource has the well-known identifier <code>/.well-known/gpc.json</code>
        relative to the origin server's URL [[RFC5785]].
      </p>
      <p>
        An origin server that receives a valid GET request targeting its GPC support resource
        responds either with a successful response containing a machine-readable representation of
        the site-wide tracking status, as defined below, or a sequence of redirects that leads to
        such a representation (which MAY be provided by a server at another origin).
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>GPC Support Representation</h2>
        <p>
          The origin server MUST return the GPC support resource as a valid representation using the
          <code>application/json</code> media type [[RFC8259]], otherwise the origin's support is
          unknown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The GPC support representation MUST be an
          <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-4">JSON object</a>, otherwise the
          origin's support is unknown. Members of this JSON object not in the list below have no
          meaning in this specification and MUST be ignored. Members include:
          <ul>
            <li>
              A <code>gpc</code> member. The value of the <code>gpc</code> member MUST be either
              <code>true</code>, to indicate that the server intends to abide by GPC requests, or
              <code>false</code>, to indicate that it does not. For any other value the origin's
              support is unknown.
            </li>
            <li>
              A <code>lastUpdate</code> member. The value of the <code>lastUpdate</code>
              member MUST an ISO 8601 date or date and time [[ISO8601]]. This indicates the time at
              which the statement of support was made, such that later changes to the meaning of the
              GPC standard should not affect the interpretation of the resource for legal purposes.
              If the member is not in a valid ISO 8601 format, the last update date and time is
              unknown.
            </li>
          </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Legal Effects</h2>
      <p>
        Receiving a GPC signal may have legal effects, depending on
        factors such as the location of the individual sending the signal, the scope of the
        applicable law, as well as any separate agreement between the recipient of the signal and
        the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, the use of the GPC signal by an individual will be intended to communicate the
        individual's intention to invoke the following rights, as applicable:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Under the CCPA, the GPC signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell request
            from a global privacy control, as per [[CCPA-REGULATIONS]] Â§999.315 for that browser or
            device, or, if known, the consumer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where the GPC signal conflicts with the existing privacy settings a consumer has with
            the business, the business shall respect the GPC signal but may notify the consumer of
            the conflict and give the consumer an opportunity to confirm the business-specific
            privacy setting or participation in the financial incentive program [[CCPA-REGULATIONS]]
            Â§999.315(c)(2).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While still experimental, GPC could potentially be used to indicate rights in other jurisdictions as well. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Under NRS 603A, a GPC signal will be intended to communicate a Do Not Sell My Personal
            Information request [[SB220]].
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The GDPR requires that "Natural persons should have control of their own personal data"
            ([[GDPR]], Recital 7). The GPC signal is intended to convey a general request that data
            controllers limit the sale or sharing of the user's personal data to other data
            controllers ([[GDPR]] Articles 7 &amp; 21). This request is expressed with every
            interaction that the user agent has with the server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that this request is not meant to withdraw a user's consent to local storage as per
            the ePrivacy Directive ("cookie consent") ([[EPRIVACY-DIRECTIVE]]) nor is it intended to
            object to direct marketing under legitimate interest ([[GDPR]]).
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Given the complexities of existing consent frameworks, publishers who accept the GPC signal
        should disclose how they treat the GPC signal in that jurisdiction and how they deal with
        conflicts between the signal and other specific privacy choices that the user has already
        made directly with the publisher, including instances where third party sharing may be
        permitted such as sharing to service providers/processors, sharing at law or at the
        direction of the individual.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>User Interface Language</h2>
        <p>
          Studies have shown that users do not want their data sold or shared. However, in some
          jurisdictions they can only avail themselves of that preference by explicitly asserting
          control.
        </p>
        <p>
          User agents are expected, where required, to present all the appropriate notices to users
          to ensure that the rights they wish to avail themselves of are effectively binding.

    <section class="appendix">
      <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        It is worth considering that a GPC signal will be attached to every HTTP request made to a
        given site. Rendering a page on the Web often requires making dozens such requests. As such
        it can prove impractical for GPC signals to trigger full-blown opt-out procedures with
        costly audit trails for every single GPC interaction as that will cause a large amount of
        processing, including for resources served from a content delivery network (CDN) that must
        be executed as efficiently as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regulations that intend to support GPC are encouraged to consider such implementation
        difficulties. One way of addressing them is to differentiate between user interface
        affordances given to users for the purpose of requesting a <a>do-not-sell-or-share
        interaction</a> preference to persist on the site, and the provision of a
        <a>do-not-sell-or-share interaction</a> signal the state of which is maintained with the
        user agent. In the latter case, the interaction can be processed as if the user had
        previously requested such a <a>do-not-sell-or-share interaction</a> preference and were
        interacting with that preference already active.
